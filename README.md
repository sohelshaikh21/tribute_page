# Tribute Page

### This is a first Web Project required to be completed by FCC (FreeCodeCamp).

#### Here are the user stories completed by me : 

#### User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
#### User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
#### User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
#### User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
#### User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
#### User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
#### User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.
